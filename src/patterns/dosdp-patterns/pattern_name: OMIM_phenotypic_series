pattern_name: OMIM_phenotypic_series

description: This patterrn is meant to be used for OMIM phenotypic series (OMIMPS), which are represented as grouping classes in Mondo. 
Examples: MONDO:0016296 holoprosencephaly (OMIMPS:236100), MONDO_0007477 '3-M syndrome' (OMIMPS:273750). Note: 
- every instance of this metaclass should be equivalent to (via annotated xref) to something in OMIMPS namespace
- it will never have an asserted causative gene as logical axiom (and no single causative gene in text def)
- it must never be equivalent to an OMIM:nnnnnn (often redundant with the above rule)
- it must have an acronym synonym, e.g. HPE
- it must have two or more subclasses (direct or indirect) that are equivalent to OMIMs
- the subclasses should (not must) have a logical def that uses the PS as a genus (see https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/blob/master/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns/disease_series_by_gene.yaml)
- the OMIM subclasses must have acronym synonyms that are the parent syn + number, e.g. HPE1, HPE2
- the primary label for the children should also be parent + {"type"} + number
- the first member will usually have the same number local ID as the PS
- the first member in OMIM usually has documentation that is pertinent to the parent PS
- the members may(?) generally share high semantic similarity
