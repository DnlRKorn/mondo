pattern_name: allergic_form_of_disease

description: >4-

An etiological pattern that extends an etiology-generic disease to an allergic form (i.e. caused by pathological type I hypersensitivity reaction). The allergy.yaml pattern is to refine an existing disease by trigger.

Examples: [allergic respiratory disease](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0000771), [atopic eczema](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0004980), [allergic otitis media](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0021202)
