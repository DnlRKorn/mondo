# About Mondo

Mondo is a multi-purpose ontology of diseases constructed originally to merge OMIM, Orphanet, NCIT, MESH, UMLS, DOID into a single coherent structure. Mondo aims to harmonize disease definitions across the world.

Originally Mondo used IDs from these source ontologies as clique leaders. With the new Mondo, we are minting our own IDs, as we are making substantial edits on top of merging. We retain both provenance and equivalence axioms pointing back to source ontologies. However, we frequently drop or modify axioms brought in from sources.
