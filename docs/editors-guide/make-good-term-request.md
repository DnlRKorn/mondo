# How to Make a Good Term Request

The following is intended to serve as a guide for anyone who would like to contribute to the Mondo project by making new term requests.

## Does the term you are looking for already exist?
First, please look at the current Mondo and check whether the term is already there. There are several online browsers that you can use, and it is also possible to view the ontology in [Protege](http://protege.stanford.edu/).
- BioPortal: [https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/mondo](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/mondo)  
- OBO Foundry: [http://obofoundry.org/ontology/mondo.html](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/mondo.html)  
- Ontology Lookup Service: [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mondo](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mondo)

## Anatomy of a Mondo term
Once you have convinced yourself that the item you need is not already present in Mondo, please provide us with the following information

1. **Label:** What is the name of the term? This should be the name most commonly used by the community.
2. **Alternative term/Synonyms.** If you are aware of synonyms for you term, please include them in your term request.
3. **Definition.** Please try to formulate a definition of your term that will be comprehensible to non-specialists.
4. **References.** Please include a link to a published paper (provide the PubMed ID, preferrably in the format PMID:XXXXX) or other source, so that other users of the Mondo can find more information about your term.
5. **Parent term.** If possible, please suggest where your new term should be placed within the existing ontology. It is sufficient to write the name(s) of the parent term(s) (i.e., you do not need to tell us the Mondo ID, e.g., MONDO:0021726)
6. **Nano-attributiion.** Please include your [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), to receive nano-attribution for this new term. If you do not have an ORCID, you can register for free online.
