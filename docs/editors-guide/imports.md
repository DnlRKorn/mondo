# Imports

See the [imports/ folder](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/tree/master/imports).

These work in the usual way, see OBO docs for details. See [Design Pattern](https://mondo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editors-guide/e-design-patterns/) section for more details on how these are used.

If you need to remake the imports:

./run.sh make imports/foo_import.obo

(you can omit the run.sh if you are fine without Docker; this is a standard ODK thing.)
