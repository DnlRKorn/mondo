## Description 



Cancers are malignant neoplasms arising from a variety of different cell types.

This is a design pattern for classes representing cancers based on their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also represent a secondary site for metastatized cancer.

We use the generic 'disease has location' relation, which generalized over primary and secondary sites.
