### How is Mondo releated to the Monarch Initiative?

Mondo is the disease ontology for the [Monarch Initiative](https://monarchinitiative.org/), which is an NIH supported project that integrates, aligns, and re-distributes cross-species gene, genotype, variant, disease, and phenotype data. The [Monarch Browser](https://monarchinitiative.org/) allows users to browse not only human diseases but to see their links to other organisms, genes, phenotypes, and pathways, which may be of especial interest to translational researchers.

### How do I cite Mondo?

Please cite: Mungall, Christopher J., et al. 2017 [The Monarch Initiative: An Integrative Data and Analytic Platform Connecting Phenotypes to Genotypes across Species.](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/D1/D712/2605791) Nucleic Acids Research 45 (D1): D712â€“22.
