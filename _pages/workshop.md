### ClinGen Virtual Retreat 2021

#### Title
Mondo Disease Ontology (How ClinGen curators work with the Mondo Disease Ontology, which aims to harmonize disease definitions across the world)

#### Presenter
Nicole Vasilevsky

#### Description

ClinGen hosted a virtual retreat for all ClinGen contributors June 24-25, 2021. The retreat provided the ClinGen community and collaborators with an event to learn about and share new and existing work, as well as best practices across ClinGen. This presentation discussed the Mondo Disease Ontology, which is used for gene-disease annotations by ClinGen curators. The **retreat agenda** is available [here](https://clinicalgenome.org/about/events/clingen-retreat-2021/agenda/).

#### Date and Time
**June 24, 2021**  
3:40 - 5:10pm Eastern

### Mondo Upper Level Reclassification Workshop

#### Description: 
A workshop with invited members of the community to work on the top-level classification of Mondo. The workshop focused on semantic modeling of disease and defining ontology patterns. There is a great need for expert clinicians to define clinically relevant navigational grouping classes. These top down and bottom up approaches need to meet in the middle harmoniously. This workshop included clinicians and ontologists, as well as expert curators working on genes for clinical utility.

#### Date and Time
**April 05, 2021, Monday**  
8am-11am PT / 11am-2pm ET / 4pm-7pm UK / 5pm-8pm Europe

### Mondo Workshop

#### Description: 

The workshop focused on defining ontology patterns and community development processes for ontological disease descriptions. Specifically, there was a need to provision multiple attributes to a disease for computational classification. The attributes need to take into account penetrance, expressivity, genetic variation, histology, biomarkers, temporality, somatic and mosaic characteristics, environmental interactions, etc. There was a need to enable expert curation groups such as in ClinGen, EBI, Orphanet, GARD, MedGen, and OMIM to create disease definitions on the fly, capture the provenance and evidence robustly, and have an identifier for use immediately. This workshop included invited curators, clinicians and ontologists and provided an opportunity to get an overview of Mondo and the source terminologies, as well as networking opportunities.

#### Date and Location
 
**Date:** November, 2018   
**Location:** Broad Institute, Cambridge MA
