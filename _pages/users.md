[Monarch Initiative](https://monarchinitiative.org/) | Monarch is a system that allows for cross-species disease discovery, and Mondo was initially developed for the Monarch Initiative and is used for integrating disease data across species. 
[Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) | A research organization that assembles a community of researchers from MIT, Harvard, and Harvard-affiliated hospitals. 
[ClinGen](https://clinicalgenome.org/) | ClinGen is a curated database of clinically relevant genes and variants. Mondo is used annotating diseases associated with gene variants.
[Critcal Path Institute](https://c-path.org/) | An independent nonprofit, public-private partnership with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) focused on the medical product development process.
[European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases](https://www.ejprarediseases.org/) | An Europe-based information resource for rare diseases.
[Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/) | EBI develops and aligns Mondo with the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) for integration of data across EBI.

[Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Portal](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/) | The Kids First Data Resource Portal is a curated database of clinical and genetic sequence data from pediatric patients with structural abnormalities or childhood cancers, and Mondo is used to structure diagnosis information.
[Genomics England Panel App](https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/) | A crowdsourcing tool to allow gene panels to be shared, downloaded, viewed and evaluated by the scientific community for use in rare disease diagnosis.
[Global Alliance for Genomics & Health (GAG4H)](https://www.ga4gh.org/) | A policy-framing and technical standards-setting organization that aims to enable responsible genomic data sharing within a human rights framework.
[HL7 International](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TA/External+Terminologies+-+Information) | A standards developing organization that provides a comprehensive framework and related standards for the exchange, integration, sharing and retrieval of electronic health information that supports clinical practice and the management, delivery and evaluation of health services.
[Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) | A group of researchers who aim to create cellular reference maps with the position, function and characteristics of every cell type in the human body.
[Infertility Disease Database](http://mdl.shsmu.edu.cn/IDDB/module/mainpage/mainpage.jsp) | A resource for genes, experiments and clinical records related with the infertility diseases. 
[MSeqDR: the Mitochondrial Disease Sequence Data Resource Consortium ](https://mseqdr.org/) | Securely collects and shares data for rare diseases, patients and causative mutations.
[NCBI ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) | ClinVar aggregates information about genomic variation and its relationship to human health.
[NCBI MedGen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/) | MedGen organizes information related to human medical genetics, such as attributes of conditions with a genetic contribution. MedGen maps their disease pages to Mondo IDs.
[NCI Cancer Research Data Commons](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons) | A cloud-based data science infrastructure that connects data sets with analytics tools to allow users to share, integrate, analyze, and visualize cancer research data to drive scientific discovery.
[Penn TURBO](http://upibi.org/turbo/) | TURBO transforms relational electronic health record (EHR) data into a semantic graph. Mondo is used for disease annotations and integration of disease data.
[Pharos](https://pharos.nih.gov/diseases) | Pharos provides a interface to the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program. Diseases in the Pharos database are maped to Mondo terms and IDs.
[Pombase](https://www.pombase.org/) | A comprehensive database for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, providing structural and functional annotation, literature curation and access to large-scale data sets.
